# <Pre-work Study Guide>

## Description

This project was created as part of a prework prerequisite for an Edex bootcamp I am starting.
Not only has this project helped me earn points in the class ( as it is a graded assignment ) but it has 
also allowed me to gain essential skills that I will use to hit the ground running when the course officially
starts. I completed this project by following templates from the course, following documented instructions
and adding some of my own input when prompted (aka un-ordered list points)
